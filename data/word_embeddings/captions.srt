1
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:06,640
so this is how

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:07,200
the word bias interface looks like when

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,840
you first

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:12,320
open it each of these axes represents

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,799
one kind of bias and each of these

6
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:16,560
lines represent one word so let's say we

7
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:17,359
hover over any specific word let's say

8
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,560
the word

9
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:21,119
nazi we see that uh this word has a

10
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,279
strong

11
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:24,400
male bias strong bias towards

12
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:27,920
christianity

13
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:30,960
strong bias towards white race so

14
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:32,000
at a very instant we can see how a

15
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,239
single word

16
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,520
has different associations or different

17
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:37,600
kinds of biases

18
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,559
we can do this similarly for other words

19
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,879
let's say

20
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:45,520
looter or sultan or perfumes

21
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:47,360
socialite socialite as you can see it

22
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:50,000
has a strong female bias

23
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,680
strong islamic bias strong white bias

24
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,640
etc

25
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:56,719
so this interface also supports all the

26
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,480
basic functionality that a typical

27
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:01,039
parallel coordinate should have so

28
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,079
for better uh identifying the

29
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:05,600
relationships

30
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:08,720
we can reorder the axis like this

31
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,520
to see how the two relations exist or

32
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,720
does not

33
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:15,680
exist we can even uh to prevent the

34
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:17,360
problem of overplotting we can even use

35
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,200
curve smoothness here

36
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,040
so everything becomes curved as we

37
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,680
increase it more and more

38
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:25,280
uh similarly uh especially when you have

39
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,000
lots and lots of points it becomes

40
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,920
difficult to

41
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,159
understand the pattern so we can even

42
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:33,280
change the opacity

43
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:36,640
zero means nothing if you increase it

44
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:38,400
it goes on okay

45
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,079
uh so let's try one more thing let's

46
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,960
look for a specific word here let's look

47
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:43,439
for the word

48
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,439
mafia

49
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:49,439
when you click the word mafia you can

50
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,560
see here right that there is one blue

51
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:52,479
word mafia

52
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,320
and there are all the other orange lines

53
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:56,159
these orange lines represent basically

54
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:57,439
the synonyms or the neighbors in high

55
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,119
dimensional space

56
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:01,040
so we can clearly see that the word

57
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:04,240
mafia let's say have a strong

58
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:08,479
male bias 0.90 ah

59
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:11,599
and probably rich as well 0.64

60
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:13,920
and f and black 0.95

61
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:16,400
so we can very clearly see here that

62
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,400
among all of these points in general

63
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,720
uh there's a large concentration of

64
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:23,440
points towards males and towards blacks

65
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,720
so we can say that this particular word

66
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,599
i'm building things

67
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,879
that uh gangsters or mafias are

68
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:31,519
typically supposed to be

69
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:32,480
black males which is not a good thing

70
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:35,519
right it's

71
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:36,959
like uh putting a stereotype on blacks

72
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:38,800
and mills

73
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,560
right now we're using only this small

74
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,879
subspace of points that you are seeing

75
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,480
here and this histogram represents the

76
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:46,640
whole distribution of bias

77
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:49,120
all the points so we can move around to

78
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:51,599
get different words in this

79
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,560
in this space here we can choose any

80
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:55,040
column we want

81
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,080
and we can even choose multiple ranges

82
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,080
we can

83
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,400
do like this and we will see all the

84
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:04,159
corresponding points here

85
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:06,720
uh one more thing that we can do is

86
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:08,640
uh to check for neutral words we can

87
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,879
just go over here and let's say

88
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:13,280
their set of words right extremism

89
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:14,800
personality traits appearance profession

90
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,640
these are a set of words that we can use

91
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,879
to quickly audit a word in wedding

92
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,239
click this play button will actually

93
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:22,400
show you all the

94
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:24,560
professions and you can clearly see how

95
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:27,920
they line up against different kinds of

96
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:31,440
biases so let's say the word dentist

97
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:33,920
has a black bias here or

98
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,640
the word dancer has a strong female bias

99
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:38,560
here

100
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:40,959
surgeon has islamic bias and

101
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,760
strong male bias as well so we can go

102
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:44,879
around and

103
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:46,480
play with it one more thing is that if

104
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:48,239
you want to see all the points we can

105
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,480
just simply extend this over

106
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:51,599
and we will get all of all the points

107
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:54,640
that we can think of

108
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:56,879
and then we can uh then

109
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:59,599
what we can do is uh let's say we want

110
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:02,879
to look for intersectional bias for

111
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:06,159
black females so we will

112
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:08,560
look out for the axis race we'll go down

113
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:08,959
here and choose the words at the extreme

114
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,920
end

115
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:14,879
to represent blacks let's say we choose

116
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:18,720
the top 20 percentile so uh

117
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:19,120
point eight zero to one similarly we can

118
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,000
go

119
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,479
and uh choose female over here at the

120
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,440
top

121
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:27,199
gender again we will choose uh 20

122
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,840
percentile over here

123
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:29,840
as well

124
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,639
and then we will choose let's say poor i

125
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:37,440
want to see poor

126
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:37,440
black females

127
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,800
so now you see these words over here

128
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,160
right these all words are representative

129
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,199
of

130
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:49,280
black poor females so let's say words

131
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:52,560
like handicraft emancipation

132
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:57,280
infertile viewers turmeric

133
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:59,919
subjugation deformity destitution

134
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:01,759
etc etc we can do this similarly for any

135
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:04,479
kind of buyers any kind of

136
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:06,160
uh intersectional bias that you want to

137
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:07,039
one last thing that i want to show is

138
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,120
that

139
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:10,479
we have this default set of biases right

140
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,240
that we see over here

141
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:14,400
but let's say i want to i have a new

142
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,400
kind of bias that is not here already

143
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,560
so i can go down here in this section

144
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:21,280
and let's say for the timing i'm just

145
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:23,520
using a template so let's say i use

146
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:27,199
something called a strength

147
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:29,840
and uh we call it one side is strong

148
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:30,880
and the words is also just strong and

149
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,039
there's weak

150
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:36,000
and there is another weak and then we

151
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:37,759
click on this word here add axis

152
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,199
so what it will do is at the back end it

153
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:41,440
will start computing

154
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,639
the bias scores for this new particular

155
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,400
kind of bias across

156
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:46,639
all these words that you are seeing here

157
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,720
and then it will show up here as a new

158
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:50,160
axis in the end apart from what we

159
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,680
already have

160
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,800
because um um we are using

161
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,720
we are not using any parallel

162
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,720
implementation so it takes some time

163
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,160
but as you can see here it showed up

164
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:03,759
right there's a new

165
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:07,360
uh bias axis that we just

166
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:07,360
generated here similarly we
